                        <h2>1. Purpose</h2>

                        <p>The Perl Foundation believes our community should be truly open for
                        everyone. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and
                        welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual
                        orientation, disability, ethnicity, religion, preferred operating
                        system, programming language, or text editor.</p>

                        <p>This code of conduct outlines our expectations for participant
                        behavior. We invite all sponsors, volunteers, speakers, attendees,
                        vendors, and other participants to help us realize a safe and positive
                        conference experience for everyone.</p>

                        <h2>2. Scope</h2>
                        <p>We expect all conference participants (sponsors, volunteers, speakers,
                        attendees, vendors, and other guests) to abide by this code of conduct
                        at all conference venues and conference-related social events.</p>

                        <h2>3. Expected Behavior</h2>
                        <p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Be considerate, respectful, and collaborative.</li>
                                <li>Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory or harassing behavior and speech.</li>
                                <li>Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants.</li>

                        discriminatory, derogatory or demeaning conduct by any attendees. All

                        respectful to all patrons of these locations.</p>
