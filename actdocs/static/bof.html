<h2>Birds of a Feather Sessions</h2>

<p class="sweet-justice">Birds of a Feather (BoF) sessions provide face to face exposure to
those interested in the same projects and concepts. BoFs can be
organized for individual projects or broader topics (best practices,
open data, standards). BoFs are entirely up to you: you provide the engaging topic.
<a href="[% make_uri('wiki?node=SuggestedBOFs') %]">Share your topic on the wiki</a>,
then we'll promote it at the conference and help you schedule space and time.
</p>

<h3>Scheduling</h3>

<p class="sweet-justice">Space and a notice on the official schedule will be allocated during
the conference for people who would like to hold BoF sessions. Spaces
will be allocated in a first-come first-serve manner. Please contact us at
<a href="mailto:hackathon@yapcna.org">hackathon@yapcna.org</a> if you would like
help scheduling your BoF. Include the topic, synopsis, and estimated length of
the BoF session for scheduling purposes.</p>
